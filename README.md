<h1>Google-Tasks</h1>
<h2>A to-do list site that syncs with google tasks and provides a standalone website for using google tasks on pc!</h2>
<hr>
The goal of the project is to create a standalone website for google tasks because if you visit tasks.google.com there is nothing! You can only access it from other google suite websites such as google calendar but for whatever reason it does not have its own website. Hence we are creating a website where you can add your tasks and it will sync with your Google Tasks smartphone app giving you full accessibility to use google tasks either from your phone or your computer!!
<hr>
<h2>Current Progress :- </h2>
<h3>Currently we have completed making the login page for our website where the user can either login with their google account or create a new account in our database to store their tasks and to-dos</h3>
<hr>
<h2>What's Left :- </h2>
<h3>We have a to-do list page almost ready which we will be uploading to this repo soon. After that we will connect these two pages and implement the google login and the Google Tasks API such that it syncs with your google account and smartphone app. After that our goal will be to make the website as close to an authentic google looking site as possible and then publish it!</h3>
